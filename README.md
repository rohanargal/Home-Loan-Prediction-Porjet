# Home-Loan-Prediction-Porject
1.	Home Loan Prediction

       Primary Goal:     The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a home loan applicant is likely to default on their loan or not thus reducing the risk of loan defaults.
       
      Solution:   To achieve this , first collect a dataset of historical loan applications and their outcomes. then preprocess and clean the data  and transform the data for ML model. explore and compare different machine learning algorithms ,evaluation metrics to assess the performance of each model and choose the best one.
      
       Result:     The result of this project will be a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict loan defaults reduction in loan defaults, improved profitability for lending institutions with the accuracy of >90%, precision 87% .
